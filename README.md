## About the Video Course
Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs allow developers to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to create apps that can more effectively understand and interpret the needs of users. Even the simplest of business applications can have a global reach, requiring developers to consider the culture and languages across regions.

This course focuses on how to implement Cognitive Services in your business or organization for day-to-day operations based on language-related services. In this course, you'll learn how to understand, configure, utilize, and work with text analysis, translator text, content moderation, Bing spell check and the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS). You'll learn the type of data that these APIs analyze, what scenarios they are best suited for, and how to leverage them in your code. You will be able to detect language, key phrases, entities, and sentiment and translate between languages in real-time. You'll delve into the exciting Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS), which allows apps to accept a user's input in natural language.

By the end of this course, you'll gain foundational knowledge of the text analytics API that will help you take your overall understanding of the Microsoft Cognitive Services suite to the next level.
